Reworks and balances the Infinity enchantment by splitting it into three tiers with each tier having a higher chance of saving an arrow and allowing bows to be enchanted with both Infinity and Mending.

- Three tiers of Infinity, each with a higher chance of saving an arrow (I - 25%, II - 50%, III - 75%)
- Bows can be enchanted with both Infinity and Mending
- Makes infinity compatible with both tipped and spectral arrows
- Every feature is fully configurable
